# Submarine - Worm Tunnel

## Overview
A side-scrolling tunnel navigation game. Hold to rise, release to fall. Navigate through increasingly complex tunnels with unique mechanics for each opponent.

## Design Philosophy
- **Pattern Learning**: Tunnel shapes become predictable - learn the patterns
- **New Mechanics Per Opponent**: Not just narrower tunnels, but new challenges
- **Clear Feedback**: Near-miss warnings, obvious collisions
- **Flow**: Target-based progression with collectibles for bonus

## How to Play
1. The worm automatically moves forward through the tunnel
2. **HOLD** (Space/Click/Touch) to rise
3. **RELEASE** to fall
4. Avoid the tunnel walls and obstacles
5. Collect honey for bonus points
6. Reach the target distance to win!

## Controls
- **SPACE (hold)**: Rise
- **Click/Touch (hold)**: Rise
- **Release**: Fall
- **ESC**: Return to previous screen

## Tunnel Mechanics

| Opponent | Mechanic |
|----------|----------|
| Funky Frog | Wide tunnels - learn controls |
| Cheeky Chicken | **Collectibles** - honey drops! |
| Disco Dinosaur | **Rhythm tunnels** - walls pulse |
| Radical Raccoon | **Obstacles** - rocks to avoid |
| Electric Eel | **Speed zones** - boost/slow areas |
| Mysterious Moth | **Darkness** - can't see tunnel! |
| Professor Penguin | **Ice physics** - slippery controls |
| Sly Snake | **Winding tunnels** - sharp turns |
| Wolf Warrior | **Moving walls** - tunnel shifts |
| Grand Master Grizzly | **ALL MECHANICS!** |

## Scoring
- Base score from distance traveled
- **Honey** 🍯 = +10 points
- **Golden Star** ⭐ = +50 points
- Reach target distance to win

## Win Conditions
- Each level has a target distance
- Reach the target to pass
- Collect bonuses for extra stars

## Tips
1. Learn the natural rhythm of holding/releasing
2. Ice physics = slower response - plan ahead!
3. In dark zones, memorize the tunnel shape before entering
4. Speed boost zones require quick reactions
5. Winding tunnels - watch the upcoming path, not your worm
6. Moving walls have a pattern - learn it!

## Why This Game is Fun
- **Simple Controls**: One input, deep mastery
- **Varied Challenges**: Each tunnel type requires different skills
- **Clear Goals**: Distance target is always visible
- **Pattern Recognition**: Tunnels become readable with practice
- **Near-Miss Excitement**: Close calls feel thrilling
