# Basketball Toss - Honey Hoops

## Overview
A physics-based basketball shooting game where timing is everything. Each opponent introduces NEW mechanics to master, not just harder versions of the same thing.

## Design Philosophy
Based on Jesse Schell's "Art of Game Design" and Raph Koster's "Theory of Fun":
- **Pattern Learning**: Each court introduces a new pattern to learn
- **Flow State**: Dynamic difficulty adjusts based on your performance
- **Clear Feedback**: Ball trail shows exactly where you went wrong
- **Meaningful Variation**: Each opponent has unique mechanics, not just "faster"

## How to Play
1. Watch the power meter oscillate back and forth
2. Press SPACE or click SHOOT when the meter is in the "sweet spot" (around 75%)
3. The ball arcs toward the hoop based on your power
4. Adjust for wind, obstacles, and court-specific mechanics

## Controls
- **SPACE**: Shoot
- **Click SHOOT button**: Shoot
- **ESC**: Return to previous screen

## Scoring
- **Swish** (center of hoop): 3 points
- **Clean shot**: 2 points
- **Rim bounce**: 1 point
- **Miss**: 0 points
- **Streak bonus**: 3+ consecutive hits = 2x points!

## Win Conditions
- 10 shots per round
- Score 40%+ of max points to pass
- Score 70%+ for bonus progression

## Court Mechanics (What Makes Each Opponent Unique)

| Opponent | Court Type | New Mechanic to Learn |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Funky Frog | Basic | Learn the arc - power = distance |
| Cheeky Chicken | Gentle Wind | Wind pushes ball - compensate! |
| Disco Dinosaur | Rhythm Hoop | Hoop pulses bigger on the BEAT |
| Radical Raccoon | Obstacles | Trash cans block certain shots |
| Electric Eel | Charged Zones | Zones speed up/slow down ball |
| Mysterious Moth | Spotlight | Darkness hides parts of the court |
| Professor Penguin | Ice | Ball trajectory curves on ice |
| Sly Snake | Moving Hoop | Hoop moves side to side |
| Wolf Warrior | Multi-Hoop | Multiple hoops, find the active one |
| Grand Master Grizzly | Chaos | ALL mechanics combined! |

## Dynamic Difficulty (Flow System)
The game secretly adjusts to keep you in "the zone":
- **Making shots**: Game gets slightly harder (faster meter, smaller sweet spot)
- **Missing shots**: Game gets slightly easier (slower meter, larger sweet spot)

This keeps you challenged but not frustrated!

## Progression
- Each successful round earns 1-2 stars
- 10 stars per opponent = mastered
- Must master an opponent to unlock the next
- 100 total stars across all opponents

## Tips
1. Watch the sweet spot indicator (green zone) - aim there!
2. Wind direction is shown at the top - compensate accordingly
3. Each court teaches something - learn the pattern before pushing hard
4. Streaks are powerful - play consistently rather than going for risky shots
5. Grand Master Grizzly combines EVERYTHING - practice each court first!

## Why This Game is Fun (Design Notes)
- **Autonomy**: You choose when to shoot
- **Competence**: Clear skill progression as you master each court
- **Novelty**: Each opponent introduces genuinely new mechanics
- **Fair Feedback**: Ball trajectory shows exactly what happened
- **No Grinding**: Each court teaches something valuable
