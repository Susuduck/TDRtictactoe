# Flappy Teddy

## Overview
A classic flappy bird-style game with a twist - each opponent introduces unique flight mechanics. Tap to flap through pipe gaps and reach your target!

## Design Philosophy
- **Pattern Learning**: Pipe patterns become predictable
- **New Mechanics Per Opponent**: Not just smaller gaps - new challenges
- **Clear Feedback**: Obvious collision points
- **Agency**: Choose safe path vs risky bonus collectibles

## How to Play
1. Teddy constantly falls due to gravity
2. **TAP** (Space/Click/Touch) to flap upward
3. Navigate through gaps in the pipes
4. Reach the target number of pipes to win
5. Collect honey for bonus points!

## Controls
- **SPACE**: Flap
- **Click/Touch**: Flap
- **ESC**: Return to menu
