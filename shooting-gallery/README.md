# Shooting Gallery - Pest Blaster

## Overview
A fast-paced target shooting game where bugs pop up and you must blast them before they disappear. Each opponent introduces NEW mechanics, not just faster spawns.

## Design Philosophy
- **Pattern Learning**: Targets spawn in learnable patterns (formations with Professor Penguin)
- **Combo System**: Builds upon skill - chain hits for bonus points
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for hits, misses, and combos
- **Agency**: Strategic target selection (high value vs safe)
- **New Mechanics Per Opponent**: Each arena teaches something new

## How to Play
1. Click or tap on bugs to shoot them
2. Each bug type has different point values
3. Chain hits for combo multipliers
4. DON'T shoot the friendly Worm Gang members!
5. 60 seconds per round

## Controls
- **Click/Tap**: Shoot at that position
- **ESC**: Return to previous screen
